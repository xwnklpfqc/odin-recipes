    <h1><u>State Fair Lemonade</u></h1>
    <img src="../img/lemonade.jpg" alt="Vibrant yellow lemonade">
    <h2><u>Description</u></h2>
    <p>
        This lemonade recipe is for real, authentic, vintage lemonade—the kind you <br>
        might enjoy on a hot summer day at one of those stands at the state fair. Most of <br>
        us make lemonade just out of lemon juice, but as you may know, the oils in the <br>
        lemon peel contain a tremendous amount of flavor, and once you drink this, you <br>
        won't want to go back to drinking it how you used to.
    </p>
    <h2><u>Ingredients</u></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 lemons</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups white sugar</li>
        <li>5 cups cold water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><u>Steps</u></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Wash lemons and peel off all the zest using a vegetable peeler; set peeled <br>
            lemons aside. Add lemon zest to a bowl and cover with sugar; toss to combine. <br>
            Cover and let sit for a minimum of 2 hours, or up to overnight.
        </li><br>

        <li>
            Bring water to a boil in a pot over high heat; turn off heat and pour in <br>
            lemon-sugar mixture. Stir and let sit until sugar is completely dissolved, <br>
            about 5 minutes.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Pour through a mesh strainer back into the same bowl and discard the zest. <br>
            Let cool to room temperature, 20 to 30 minutes.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Cut lemons in half and squeeze juice into the bowl. Pour lemonade into <br>
            a serving pitcher; cover and chill thoroughly before serving over ice, at least 2 <br>
            hours.
        </li>        
    </ol>
